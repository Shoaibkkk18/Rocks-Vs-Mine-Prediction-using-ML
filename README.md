📌 Project Overview
This project implements a Machine Learning model to classify objects as either Rock or Mine based on SONAR data. The system is built using Python and utilizes the Logistic Regression model for prediction.

🚀 Technologies Used
Python
Pandas (for data handling)
NumPy (for numerical computations)
Scikit-Learn (for model training and evaluation)
Matplotlib & Seaborn (for data visualization)
Google Colaboratory (for implementation)
📊 Dataset
We are using the SONAR dataset, which contains 60 numerical attributes representing signal frequencies bounced off an object. Each instance is labeled as either:

Rock ("R") – if the object is a rock
Mine ("M") – if the object is a mine
🏗️ Project Workflow
Data Preprocessing

Load the dataset

Normalize data for better model performance
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Understand feature distributions
Visualize data patterns
Model Training

Split dataset into training and testing sets
Train
